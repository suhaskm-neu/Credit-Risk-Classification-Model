# PyTorch Neural Network for Loan Repayment Prediction

## Overview
This project leverages the power of PyTorch to develop a Neural Network model that predicts whether an individual will repay a loan or default. This task is crucial in the financial sector, aiding in the decision-making process for loan approvals. The model's unique strength lies in its ability to handle imbalanced datasets, a common challenge in real-world scenarios.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Special focus on handling imbalanced datasets. Utilizes the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) to ensure a balanced representation of classes, enhancing the model's ability to learn from minority classes.
- **Model Architecture:** Several prototype Neural Network architectures have been explored and iteratively improved to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Uses a range of metrics to evaluate model performance, considering the challenges posed by imbalanced datasets.

## Dependencies
- **PyTorch**
- **Imbalanced-learn for implementing SMOTE**
- **Other common Python data science libraries (NumPy, Pandas, etc.)**
## Usage
- **Provide instructions on how to use the model, including data preparation, training the model, and making predictions.**
